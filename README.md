# Matlab Multinest

A Matlab nested sampling implementation

This code can make use of either the MultiNest sampler of [Feroz, Hobson & Bridges](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0809.3437) or a version of the MCMC sampler of [Veitch & Vecchio](http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3820) to generate samples within a standard nested sampling routine.

Release versions of this code are also hosted on [CCPforge](https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/).
